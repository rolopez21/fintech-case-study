# Robo-advising

Robo-advisors or Robo-advisers are a class of financial adviser that provide advise for investment management online, depending on type of service human interaction can be minimal or moderate.
These Robo-advisors provide digital financial advise based on mathematical rules or algorithms.[1]

Robo advisors can be dated back as far as 2006 when Mint launched semi-automated personal finance management. Later in 2008 the robo advisor emerged following the financial crash. Several investment companies recognized the benefits of investing in this way. By allowing individuals to invest money in funds directly, robo advisors cut out the middleman - and the costs that come with it. This resulted in quicker, simpler and cheaper way to invest. For these reasons experts predicts robo advisors will become $5 trillion industry.

Important dates for robo advisors industry:
2008 First robo advisor is made available to the public.
2009 Mint is sold to Intuit for $170 million, providing demand for online investment services.
2010 Future advisor is first to robo advisor to directly link to retirement accounts.
2010 US robo advisor Betterment launches, goes on to become world’s biggest.
2014 Assets managed by robo advisors climbs to $19 billion.
2015 Betterment becomes the world’s biggest robo advisor 5 years after launch

*Betterment

*Incorporated April 7, 2009

Betterment was founded in 2008 in New York City by Jon Stein, a Columbia Business School MBA graduate, and Eli Broverman, a lawyer out of NYU School of Law.

 Betterment started when it occurred to Jon Stein that the concepts he learned while studying behavioral economics and biology in college could actually apply to the many mistakes he was making in managing my own investments.

While economics is good at explaining the world at a macro level, it fails to explain human behavior. At a micro level, economics assumes that humans are rational, and they’re far from rational. Especially when it comes to their money; people heavily discount the future, they withdraw when markets crash, and it’s because our emotions drive our decisions.

As the example of bad investing behavior, he was investing  money through seven different brokerage accounts. he was constantly monitoring his accounts (bad behavior) and trying to time the market (worse behavior), and the result was wasting time, taxes, and transaction costs, without making any more than he would have in an index fund (bad outcome).

He wanted a service that did all of this: told him what to do with my money, and then did it. he realized that the only way he was going to get something like that was to build it myself.[3]


Betterment received Series A round funding from Bessemer Venture Partners in December 2010. By October 2012, Menlo Ventures provided Series B funding along with Bessemer Venture Partners and Anthemis Group.

The maturing roboadvisor market as it embraces the human side of advising. Betterment added human advisors to its mix in 2017 and last year introduced the ability for investors to tailor their automated portfolio allocations.[4]

Betterment is in an optimized diversified portfolio of low-cost stock and bond ETFs that balance risk and reward. The portfolio also has a slight small-cap and value tilt, which has tended to beat the market in the long term.
There are no minimums to open an account, and no costs to close one.  They have some of the lowest management costs in the industry, charging between 0.34% and 0.54% based on your balance and auto-deposit settings, including fund expenses.¹ Our automated portfolio management also saves you time—another savings of up to $2,500.
Never worry about rebalancing your account. When cash flows into your account, whether a deposit or dividend, our algorithms do a quick—and smart—rebalance (if needed) to keep your asset allocation perfectly set.
Smart Dividend Re-investment: Every time your dividends arrive, they don’t just re-invest them blindly or wait until there is enough to buy a full share. Instead our algorithms re-invest every penny where you need to shore up imbalances to make sure you’re on track with your investments.
Our trading system can swap fractional shares—as small as 1/1,000,000 of a share—which means you never have money sitting on the sidelines and maximize every dollar you have invested.
As efficiency junkies at Betterment, they can’t stand the thought of even a penny sitting on the sidelines not earning returns. Inefficiency is our enemy. That’s why, when they launched our service in 2010, they put a lot of work into supporting fractional shares.

The full investment of every dollar according to your desired asset allocation means that your money is getting absolutely the most value possible out of investing. This is part of our thoughtful application of technology.
You can’t go to market and buy or sell fractional shares. However, a Betterment customer’s trades and resulting positions can be fractional—down to 1/1,000,000th of a share—putting every dollar to work while allowing every investing goal to be perfectly diversified according to its target allocation. This is part of Betterment’s unique sophistication.

In practice, it also makes our service equal opportunity for all investors. It means an investor with a $2,500 account receives the same diversification benefit as one with a $2.5 million account (and they don’t require a minimum balance). And every investor has the benefit of automatic, perfectly allocated dividend reinvestment, with no odd amounts just being wasted in cash.


Landscape:

What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?
They were made publicly available in 2008 for the first to general public who were in dire need to manage their assets personally. By the end of 2015, robo-advisers from almost 100 companies around the globe were managing $60 billion assets of clients and it is estimated that it will hit $2 trillion by the end of 2020.

What are the other major companies in this domain?
1. Vanguard
2. Betterment
3. Schwab Intelligent Portfolios
4. Personal Capital
5. FutureAdvisor
6. Wealthfront
7. WiseBanyan
8. Blooom
9. SigFig
10. Acorns


In the last decade, the entrance of robo-advisors has called into question whether a similar disruption will take place in wealth management, resulting in an overall reduction in the profit pools of traditional financial institutions. Robos have entered the space with the same strategy of looking to capture market share through lower fees and messages of accessibility.
Additionally, the collective message of these new entrants has been that a) there is no sustainable alpha; b) human service is over-priced; c) fees and rebalanced, risk-managed beta are all that matters; and d) new technology can make for a far more delightful user experience and a lower cost base.
Despite similar concerns around profit cannibalization, some major financial institutions moved to embrace this new technology and leverage the scale of their existing customer base to play in the robo-advice space. Vanguard and Schwab have leapfrogged Wealthfront and Betterment in total assets under management (AUM), and companies like Future Advisor (acquired by Blackrock) and SigFig are providing B2B robo solutions for dozens of large “traditional banks”.

This fast (by corporate standards) adoption of new technology was driven by industry predictions that robo could quickly destroy the traditional wealth management business.  That prediction has, in one sense, been overblown. In aggregate, Wealthfront and Betterment manage $25.5 billion in AUM, less than 0.03 percent of the industry; even when you add Schwab and Vanguard’s offerings, it remains less than 0.22 percent of industry assets.

However, traditional players that dismiss the impact of robo advisors will likely do so at their own peril. The real disruption is around fees and fee transparency.

Investors are regularly being told – via Betterment, Wealthfront, Vanguard and the rest of the robos – that active manager performance does not justify high fees. Paying high fees to receive active investment management is for suckers, especially when those active managers may have unrestrained conflicts between their clients’ interests and profitability.  Even if that message is aimed at a “new”, younger audience, high-value clients can’t help but hear and absorb it as well.

This of course begs the question, if human advisors are conflicted, expensive and generally fail to add alpha, what is keeping the vast majority of assets in human-driven investment strategies? Why are low fees alone not enough to change investment behavior?

Personal Capital, a robo advisor with approximately 3x the fees of Betterment and Wealthfront, has managed to grow nearly as quickly with an emphasis on combining tech tools with human advisors. Betterment has spent much of its energy in the last two years building out its institutional offering for advisors, a group it once said it would put out of business. A major reason for this is that consumers are looking for not only investment options but also for planning and advice.

A former CEO of one of the largest independent financial advisory firms said that in his experience when people hit 1x their income in savings they become aware of the fact that they need to do something different with their money. When they hit 2-3x their income, they feel a more heightened sense of anxiety about their money management, which, for most, leads to an advisor relationship.

In a survey that Bain Capital Ventures conducted of 556 Americans with $250,000 to $10 million of investable assets, the top financial concern was post-career retirement planning. When asked the most important attributes for selecting a financial advisor, the human attributes of trustworthiness and listening skills ranked highest, whereas fees scored much lower.

These survey results suggest that, even more than total fees, perceptions of conflict and the desire for transparency should concern incumbents that have historically prioritized product and distribution fees over client interests. [5]

A recommendation to this company will be expand their ‘human’ service and point out the advantage of this mixture.
