# Robo-advising

## Overview and Origin
Robo-advisors or Robo-advisers are a class of financial adviser that provide advise for investment management online, depending on type of service human interaction can be minimal or moderate.
These Robo-advisors provide digital financial advise based on mathematical rules or algorithms.[1]

Robo advisors can be dated back as far as 2006 when Mint launched semi-automated personal finance management. Later in 2008 the robo advisor emerged following the financial crash. Several investment companies recognized the benefits of investing in this way. By allowing individuals to invest money in funds directly, robo advisors cut out the middleman - and the costs that come with it. This resulted in quicker, simpler and cheaper way to invest. For these reasons experts predicts robo advisors will become $5 trillion industry.

*Betterment

*Incorporated April 7, 2009

Betterment was founded in 2008 in New York City by Jon Stein, a Columbia Business School MBA graduate, and Eli Broverman, a lawyer out of NYU School of Law.

* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?
 Betterment started when it occurred to Jon Stein that the concepts he learned while studying behavioral economics and biology in college could actually apply to the many mistakes he was making in managing my own investments.

While economics is good at explaining the world at a macro level, it fails to explain human behavior. At a micro level, economics assumes that humans are rational, and they’re far from rational. Especially when it comes to their money; people heavily discount the future, they withdraw when markets crash, and it’s because our emotions drive our decisions.

As the example of bad investing behavior, he was investing  money through seven different brokerage accounts. he was constantly monitoring his accounts (bad behavior) and trying to time the market (worse behavior), and the result was wasting time, taxes, and transaction costs, without making any more than he would have in an index fund (bad outcome).

He wanted a service that did all of this: told him what to do with my money, and then did it. he realized that the only way he was going to get something like that was to build it myself.[3]



* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?
Betterment received Series A round funding from Bessemer Venture Partners in December 2010. By October 2012, Menlo Ventures provided Series B funding along with Bessemer Venture Partners and Anthemis Group.
